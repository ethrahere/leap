# LEAP — The Creative Exit Network

*A social platform where creatives stake their escape from the 9-5.*

## 🎯 Mission

Help creative people take the leap from traditional jobs to pursuing their passions. We believe your voice should be **earned by showing up, not paying up**.

## 💡 How It Works

```
Creator joins → Stakes commitment → Posts their "leap goal"
                     ↓
Community backs them → Tips in $LEAP → Votes on grants
                     ↓
Treasury grows → Staked ETH yields → Funds leap grants
                     ↓
Creator makes the leap → Shares success → Inspires next wave
```

## 🪙 Two-Layer Token System

| Layer | Token | How you get it | What it does |
|-------|-------|----------------|--------------|
| **Economic** | $LEAP | Buy/trade | Tips, treasury funding, liquidity |
| **Reputation** | CRED | Earn only | Voting power, grant eligibility, access |

**CRED is soulbound** — can't buy it, can't transfer it. Earned by participation.
